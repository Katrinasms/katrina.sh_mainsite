### **My Struggle**

When working on website setup, hosting, certificates, and the corresponding ways to structure and configure the site nicely in HTML/CSS/JS, I can follow steps and tools to complete it.

However, sometimes when you check live sites in different browsers, you may notice varying performance. Without a clear concept of how browsers communicate with the server, it becomes challenging to debug and enhance performance.

Understanding the basic logic is always fun, so I decided to start by reading more about the HTTP Protocol â€“ the amazing technology that has transformed the ecosystem of the web.

### **Read and Understand**
I mainly go through part of the information provided in the **[Internet-draft of HTTP/1.1](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01)** to make the following summarize.

#### **What is HTTP?**
HTTP, short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

It is a :
- generic, 
- stateless, 
- object-oriented protocol which can be used for many tasks(such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods) 

A feature of HTTP is the **typing and negotiation of data representation**, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.

#### **Why HTTP?**
As there were already ways to communicate via telecommunication technologies in the 1990s, the World-Wide Web Consortium (W3C) wanted to standardize the way machines communicate. 

It's like creating a universal language that every machine could understand, so they introduced the protocol. 
That's why we have HTTP!

There were always things to improve (such as data being too raw or sending too much data at once, which decreased performance), so new versions were developed to enhance and meet the evolving needs. That's why we kept seeing new version!


#### Who create HTTP? When?
HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990.
The first version of HTTP, referred to as HTTP/0.9, was a simple protocol for raw data transfer across the Internet.
