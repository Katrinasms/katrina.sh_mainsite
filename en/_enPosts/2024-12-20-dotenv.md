When you deploy your code to cloud server, it is common to save the secret key in .env to avoid leakage of important credential key, URL and also ease to configure the variable.
If you are working with react native, unlike working in normal node.js server environment, using dotenv in react native is not working. Instead, you need to use the react-native-dotenv . Below are the required step.

#### Step 1. Inside your project directory, install the dependency react-native-dotenv

```
$ npm install -D react-native-dotenv
```

#### Step 2. As it is a babel plugin, you need to add it inside babel.config.js file

```
//babel.config.js

module.exports = function(api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: ['module:react-native-dotenv'] // <----- Add this line
  };
};
```

#### Step 3. Set up the environment variable inside .env like:

```
//.env
apiKey = askjlgdat9wettj4wksggr
appId = 1:sgsjgiklsj:web:wtwethwoiethoq
```

#### Step 4. Import the environment variable in the everywhere inside your react native project, below is an example:
```
import { apiKey,appId } from '@env';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: apiKey,
 appId: appId,
.....
};
```

Now, you can use the variable in .env! Wish this article can help you to keep enjoy coding!
