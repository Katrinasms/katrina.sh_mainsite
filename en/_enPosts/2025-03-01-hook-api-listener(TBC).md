## **My Struggle**
I am working on a wordpress project, which very common to see the word, "Hook". And based on my understanding, in the programming world, "Hook" is also a very popular word, I kind of know it's like making a connection between two parties. But the exact meaning and also difference between "hook", "API" and "Listener" "Callback" (since I'm working in a wordpress project) I still need to explore more.
