## **My Struggle**
After setting up my own [personal blog](penguingogo.com) and a few other websites, I started thinking about promotion. 

The first and easiest step that came to mind was creating a mailbox under my own domain name—because it looks cool! Haha. Plus, it looks much more professional than sending emails from a Gmail account or another email provider.

## **Setting Up a Mailbox for Your Domain Name with Zoho Mail**
To set up a custom mailbox that allows sending emails, I researched various email hosting services.

Since these are just small projects and websites for me, I wanted a solution that was either free or very affordable. Eventually, I found that **Zoho Mail** was a great option—they offer a free plan that allows you to create one custom domain email address.

Here is the link:  
[Zoho Custom Domain Email Address](https://www.zoho.com/mail/custom-domain-email.html#:~:text=Free%20plan%20for%20small%20businesses,hosting%20for%20a%20single%20domain.)

To set it up, simply follow the guide in the Zoho Mail link. You will also need access to your **DNS configuration**. Since Zoho Mail requires verification of domain ownership and provides spam screening and mailbox hosting settings, you must configure the necessary **TXT** and **MX** records in your DNS. Once Zoho Mail verifies these settings, your mailbox will be ready to use.

## **My use-case**
For me, I simply set up a "hello@penguingogo.com" by following the steps, and it worked well which I can send email under this mail address and also receive email. My next step will be setting up a subscription box in my website!

## **My Thoughts**
The whole setup process was surprisingly straightforward and very responsive—I think it only took me about **five minutes** to create my mailbox! And since it's free, I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an easy email solution.
