        Every time when come to understand the computing world, it feel like overwhelmed by the terms.

        As someone who excited to understand the hidden meaning or structure of things; the tonnes of terms and things in computing world demotivated me 😟. 
        
        Therefore, instead of trying to understanding that in a short period (which feel impossible and overwhleming for me). 
        
        I would like to use the way how I learn English to do it. Write your own vocabulary book😊 Everyday just learn a few and using the compound effect to understand the hidden meaning by years. 😄
        
        Hopefully one day I could understand most of the knowledge that I want to know 😊 And would like to share this journey to every “有緣人”.
        
        Since my experience was using react native, javascript, html, css, or some python. 
        
        I would like to start to learn relationship between my experience first then slowly expanding to other topic that I am interested in. And by the time, I would use combination of AI tools and search from google or hopefully some books as a source and record all my understanding about the glossary :) Yeah!
