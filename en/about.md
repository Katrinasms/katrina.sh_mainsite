    </div>

Someone who transitioned from working in civil engineering industry to diving into the **world of coding**. 
<br />
<br />
My journey has been anything but conventionalâ€”starting as a **noob** who followed YouTube tutorials and demo articles, end up often found myself paying for not-so-developer-friendly solutions.
<br />
<br />

With the magic of digital nomading, I met an amazing [<span style="color: #746D69;  font-weight: bold">experienced software engineer</span>](https://www.aye.sh) who shared me lots of trick in programming, which suggested me many **different programming solutions, tech stack or better way and attitude in working with programming**. 
<br />
<br />

All these information and mindset helps me lots especially in understanding the art of programming. Therefore, would love to record and share it with anyone who share similar struggle as me.
<br />
<br />

This blog is a **testament** to my ongoing journey to understand and master the art of programming, one step at a time.ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž
