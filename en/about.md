              Someone who want to be good in coding, enjoy the freedom provided by coding but still on the path to be good. 
              This is a blog to share the whole journey!
            </p>
            <p class="is-size-7 mb-1">Every time when come to understand the computing world, it feel like overwhelmed by the terms.</p>
       <p class="is-size-7 mb-1">As someone who excited to understand the hidden meaning or structure of things; the tonnes of terms and things in computing world demotivated me 😟.</p>
        <p class="is-size-7 mb-1">Therefore, instead of trying to understanding that in a short period (which feel impossible and overwhleming for me). 
        <p class="is-size-7 mb-1">I would like to use the way how I learn English to do it. Write your own vocabulary book😊 Everyday just learn a few and using the compound effect to understand the hidden meaning by years. 😄</p>
        <p class="is-size-7 mb-1">Hopefully one day I could understand most of the knowledge that I want to know 😊 And would like to share this journey to every “有緣人”.</p>
        <p class="is-size-7 mb-1">Since my experience was using react native, javascript, html, css, or some python. </p>
        <p class="is-size-7 mb-1">I would like to start to learn relationship between my experience first then slowly expanding to other topic that I am interested in. And by the time, I would use combination of AI tools and search from google or hopefully some books as a source and record all my understanding about the glossary :) Yeah!</p>
